2D Arrays
    2D arrrays are simply multiple 1D arrrays.
    we can also think about 2D arrays as a matrix of numbers.

why we need it?
    we can use the 2D arrays to store the data which is
    present in the form of rows and columns.

Syntax:
    dataType[][] matrix={
    {item,item,item,item},
    {item,item,item,item},
    {item,item,item,item},
    }

    int[][] matrix={
    {1,5,8,90},
    {10,55,80,90},
    {1,6,80,95},
    }

Second way of creating the array
    datatype[][] matrix=new int[5][3]
