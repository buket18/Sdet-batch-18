arrays;
    Arrays are collection of items.items are stored based on the indexex. When we store
    the first item an index zero is assigned to it. we can use this index to access
    the elements back from the array.
why we should learn arrays?
    1)with the help Of arrays it is possible to store and manipulate large amounts of data
    using loops which was not possible with variables.
limitations of enhanced for loop
    1)we cant skip items
    2)we cant go in backward direction
    3)we cant update the item in the array

2D Arrays;
    2D array is a collection of multiple 1D arrays. for 2D arrays we write 2 [][]
 why we should learn about 2D;
    2D arrays help us to store the data in the form of tables like storing and manipulating
the data from excel files.



shortcuts
    1)iter to write an enhanced loop
    2)fori for a normal loop
    3)
