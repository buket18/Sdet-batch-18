Arrays:
    it is a collection of similar items. the data is
    stored in consecutive memory locations inside the memory. we use indexing to store and access the
    data in an array.every element that we store in an array is assigned a number, these numbers start from 0,
    first element will be assigned number 0 then 1 and so on.

why we should use arrays:
    it is not feasible to use variables or large amounts of data.
    storing, managing, searching large amounts of data become easier with arrays and loops.

Syntax of arrays:
    we can create arrays two ways
    1) DataType[] nameOfArray={item1, item2,item3};
    String[] names={"Kawoon", "Patrick", "Halil"} the size of this array is 3. last index is 2.
    2)DataType[] nameOfArray=new DataType[size]
    int[] numbers=new int[5]; the size of numbers array is 5. the last index is 4.
